## Handling Exceptions

It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at the following example, which asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using `Control-C` or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled by raising the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception:

    >>> while True:
    ...     try:
    ...         x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
    ...         break
    ...     except ValueError:
    ...         print("Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...")
    ...

The `try` statement works as follows.

- First, the *try clause* (the statement(s) between the `try` and `except` keywords) is executed.
- If no exception occurs, the *except clause* is skipped and execution of the `try` statement is finished.
- If an exception occurs during execution of the `try` clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then, if its type matches the exception named after the `except` keyword, the *except clause* is executed, and then execution continues after the try/except block.
- If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the *except clause*, it is passed on to outer `try` statements; if no handler is found, it is an *unhandled exception* and execution stops with an error message.

A `try` statement may have more than one *except clause*, to specify handlers for different exceptions. At most one handler will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding *try clause*, not in other handlers of the same `try` statement. An *except clause* may name multiple exceptions, for example:

    ... except RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError:
    ...     pass

A class in an `except` clause matches exceptions which are instances of the class itself or one of its derived classes (but not the other way around --- an *except clause* listing a derived class does not match instances of its base classes). For example, the following code will print B, C, D in that order:

    class B(Exception):
        pass

    class C(B):
        pass

    class D(C):
        pass

    for cls in [B, C, D]:
        try:
            raise cls()
        except D:
            print("D")
        except C:
            print("C")
        except B:
            print("B")

Note that if the *except clauses* were reversed (with `except B` first), it would have printed B, B, B --- the first matching *except clause* is triggered.

When an exception occurs, it may have associated values, also known as the exception's *arguments*. The presence and types of the arguments depend on the exception type.

The *except clause* may specify a variable after the exception name. The variable is bound to the exception instance which typically has an `args` attribute that stores the arguments. For convenience, builtin exception types define `__str__` to print all the arguments without explicitly accessing `.args`:

    >>> try:
    ...     raise Exception('spam', 'eggs')
    ... except Exception as inst:
    ...     print(type(inst))    # the exception type
    ...     print(inst.args)     # arguments stored in .args
    ...     print(inst)          # __str__ allows args to be printed directly,
    ...                          # but may be overridden in exception subclasses
    ...     x, y = inst.args     # unpack args
    ...     print('x =', x)
    ...     print('y =', y)
    ...
    <class 'Exception'>
    ('spam', 'eggs')
    ('spam', 'eggs')
    x = spam
    y = eggs

The exception's `__str__` output is printed as the last part ('detail') of the message for unhandled exceptions.

`BaseException` is the common base class of all exceptions. One of its subclasses, `Exception`, is the base class of all the non-fatal exceptions. Exceptions which are not subclasses of `Exception` are not typically handled, because they are used to indicate that the program should terminate. They include `SystemExit` which is raised by `sys.exit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` which is raised when a user wishes to interrupt the program.

`Exception` can be used as a wildcard that catches (almost) everything. However, it is good practice to be as specific as possible with the types of exceptions that we intend to handle, and to allow any unexpected exceptions to propagate on.

The most common pattern for handling `Exception` is to print or log the exception and then re-raise it (allowing a caller to handle the exception as well):

    import sys

    try:
        f = open('myfile.txt')
        s = f.readline()
        i = int(s.strip())
    except OSError as err:
        print("OS error:", err)
    except ValueError:
        print("Could not convert data to an integer.")
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Unexpected {err=}, {type(err)=}")
        raise

The `try` ... `except` statement has an optional *else clause*, which, when present, must follow all *except clauses*. It is useful for code that must be executed if the *try clause* does not raise an exception. For example:

    for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
        try:
            f = open(arg, 'r')
        except OSError:
            print('cannot open', arg)
        else:
            print(arg, 'has', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
            f.close()

The use of the `else` clause is better than adding additional code to the `try` clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception that wasn't raised by the code being protected by the `try` ... `except` statement.

Exception handlers do not handle only exceptions that occur immediately in the *try clause*, but also those that occur inside functions that are called (even indirectly) in the *try clause*. For example:

    >>> def this_fails():
    ...     x = 1/0
    ...
    >>> try:
    ...     this_fails()
    ... except ZeroDivisionError as err:
    ...     print('Handling run-time error:', err)
    ...
    Handling run-time error: division by zero

## Raising Exceptions

The `raise` statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur. For example:

    >>> raise NameError('HiThere')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        raise NameError('HiThere')
    NameError: HiThere

The sole argument to `raise` indicates the exception to be raised. This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class that derives from `BaseException`, such as `Exception` or one of its subclasses). If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly instantiated by calling its constructor with no arguments:

    raise ValueError  # shorthand for 'raise ValueError()'

If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don't intend to handle it, a simpler form of the `raise` statement allows you to re-raise the exception:

    >>> try:
    ...     raise NameError('HiThere')
    ... except NameError:
    ...     print('An exception flew by!')
    ...     raise
    ...
    An exception flew by!
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
        raise NameError('HiThere')
    NameError: HiThere

## Defining Clean-up Actions

The `try` statement has another optional clause which is intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances. For example:

    >>> try:
    ...     raise KeyboardInterrupt
    ... finally:
    ...     print('Goodbye, world!')
    ...
    Goodbye, world!
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
        raise KeyboardInterrupt
    KeyboardInterrupt

If a `finally` clause is present, the `finally` clause will execute as the last task before the `try` statement completes. The `finally` clause runs whether or not the `try` statement produces an exception. The following points discuss more complex cases when an exception occurs:

- If an exception occurs during execution of the `try` clause, the exception may be handled by an `except` clause. If the exception is not handled by an `except` clause, the exception is re-raised after the `finally` clause has been executed.
- An exception could occur during execution of an `except` or `else` clause. Again, the exception is re-raised after the `finally` clause has been executed.
- If the `finally` clause executes a `break`, `continue` or `return` statement, exceptions are not re-raised. This can be confusing and is therefore discouraged. From version 3.14 the compiler emits a `SyntaxWarning` for it (see PEP 765).
- If the `try` statement reaches a `break`, `continue` or `return` statement, the `finally` clause will execute just prior to the `break`, `continue` or `return` statement's execution.
- If a `finally` clause includes a `return` statement, the returned value will be the one from the `finally` clause's `return` statement, not the value from the `try` clause's `return` statement. This can be confusing and is therefore discouraged. From version 3.14 the compiler emits a `SyntaxWarning` for it (see PEP 765).

For example:

    >>> def bool_return():
    ...     try:
    ...         return True
    ...     finally:
    ...         return False
    ...
    >>> bool_return()
    False

A more complicated example:

    >>> def divide(x, y):
    ...     try:
    ...         result = x / y
    ...     except ZeroDivisionError:
    ...         print("division by zero!")
    ...     else:
    ...         print("result is", result)
    ...     finally:
    ...         print("executing finally clause")
    ...
    >>> divide(2, 1)
    result is 2.0
    executing finally clause
    >>> divide(2, 0)
    division by zero!
    executing finally clause
    >>> divide("2", "1")
    executing finally clause
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        divide("2", "1")
        ~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^
      File "<stdin>", line 3, in divide
        result = x / y
                 ~~^~~
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'

As you can see, the `finally` clause is executed in any event. The `TypeError` raised by dividing two strings is not handled by the `except` clause and therefore re-raised after the `finally` clause has been executed.

In real world applications, the `finally` clause is useful for releasing external resources (such as files or network connections), regardless of whether the use of the resource was successful.
